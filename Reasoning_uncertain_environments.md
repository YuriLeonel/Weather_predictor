## Overview

This document explores probabilistic reasoning techniques used in constructing intelligent agents that operate effectively under uncertainty. The focus is on understanding how different probabilistic models handle varying levels of complexity in real-world applications.

## Probabilistic Reasoning Fundamentals

**Definition:**
Probabilistic reasoning provides a framework for building intelligent agents that can make rational decisions when faced with incomplete or uncertain information.

**Core Techniques:**
- Bayesian networks
- Bayes' theorem
- Markov-based models

**Purpose:**
These techniques enable agents to quantify uncertainty, model dependencies between variables, and make informed predictions about future states.

## Comparative Model Analysis

### Model 1: Weather Prediction

**Characteristics:**
- Relatively simple probabilistic model
- State evolution depends primarily on current conditions
- Temporal dependencies are straightforward

**Approach:**
The next state (tomorrow's weather) is predicted based on the current state (today's meteorological conditions), without requiring complex multi-variable interactions.

**Complexity Level:** Low to Medium

### Model 2: Medical Diagnosis

**Characteristics:**
- Requires sophisticated probabilistic modeling
- Multiple interacting variables must be considered simultaneously
- Complex dependency structures between symptoms, tests, and conditions

**Variables Considered:**
- Patient medical history
- Laboratory test results
- Current symptoms
- Known disease patterns

**Complexity Level:** High

## Markov Chains

### Definition

Markov chains are probabilistic models based on the **Markov property**: the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of states that preceded it.

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **States** | Discrete conditions the system can occupy |
| **Transition Matrix** | Probability distribution governing state transitions |
| **Current State** | The present condition of the system |
| **Markov Property** | Memoryless characteristicâ€”future depends only on present |

### Application Example: Weather Forecasting

**Implementation:**
A transition matrix encodes the probability of weather conditions changing from one day to the next:

- If today is sunny, what is the probability tomorrow will be sunny, cloudy, or rainy?
- These probabilities form the transition matrix
- Predictions are generated by applying the matrix to the current state

**Advantages:**
- Computationally efficient
- Clear mathematical foundation
- Suitable for systems with limited state dependencies

## Markov Networks

### Definition

Markov networks (also known as Markov random fields) extend the concept of Markov chains to handle **complex problems with multiple interdependent variables**.

### Key Characteristics

**Multi-Variable Dependencies:**
- Models simultaneous interactions between multiple variables
- Captures bidirectional relationships
- Represents complex conditional dependencies

**Contrast with Markov Chains:**
- Markov chains: Linear temporal progression
- Markov networks: Graph-based representation of variable interactions

### Application Example: Medical Diagnosis

**Scenario:**
In medical diagnosis, symptoms often influence each other:
- Fever may correlate with fatigue
- Cough may correlate with chest pain
- Multiple symptoms collectively indicate specific conditions

**Modeling Approach:**
A Markov network represents these mutual influences, allowing the system to:
- Evaluate symptom correlations
- Assess conditional probabilities given observed evidence
- Generate diagnostic hypotheses based on the complete symptom profile

## Python Implementation

### Weather Prediction with Markov Chains

**Implementation Components:**

1. **State Definition:**
   - Enumerate possible weather states (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)

2. **Transition Matrix:**
   - Define probability distribution for state transitions
   - Each row represents probabilities of transitioning from one state to all possible next states

3. **Prediction Function:**
   - Accept current state as input
   - Apply transition matrix to generate next-state probability distribution
   - Return predicted weather condition

**Code Structure:**
```python
# Define states
states = ['sunny', 'cloudy', 'rainy']

# Define transition matrix
# Rows: current state | Columns: next state probabilities
transition_matrix = [
    [0.7, 0.2, 0.1],  # From sunny
    [0.3, 0.4, 0.3],  # From cloudy
    [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]   # From rainy
]

# Prediction function
def predict_weather(current_state, transition_matrix):
    # Returns probability distribution for next day's weather
    pass
```

### 2. Fraud Detection

**Application:**
- Transaction sequences analyzed for anomalous patterns
- Normal behavior modeled as typical state transitions
- Deviations from expected transition probabilities flag potential fraud

**Advantages:**
- Real-time detection capability
- Adaptable to evolving fraud patterns
- Efficient computational performance

### 3. Web Interface Optimization

**Use Case:**
- User navigation flow through website pages
- Optimize page layout and linking structure
- Predict next likely user action

**Optimization Goals:**
- Reduce friction in user journeys
- Increase conversion rates
